# TDonCashless

This is an attempt of constructing a cashless authentication service using a microservices approach.

- Using RabbitMQ as the Message queuing layer
- Using MediatR for Commands and Events communication
- MSSQL Database using EntityFrameworkCore as the ORM
- SwaggerUI for API definition
- Inversion of Control for Dependency Injection

I learned a lot from this project and I am certain that I will keep getting better and better as a software developer.
